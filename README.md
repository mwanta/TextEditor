# TextEditor
A text editor that supports text insertion and deletion at any position, with real-time cursor tracking and highlighting.

This is a work in progress, the current functionality is:
- Track location with a blue cursor.

    - The cursor will move to a clicked position.
    - This cursor can also move with the left and right arrow keys.
- Type new characters at any space in the editor before the cursor.
- Backspace to delete charaters at any space in the editor before the cursor.
- Ability to shift for uppercase and special symbols.
  

Planned improvements:
- Add ability to enter to go down a line.
- Add other classes of text, such as a header or subtext.
