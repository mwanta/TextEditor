# TextEditor
A basic text editor that has the ability to type, backspace, and track location with a cursor.

This is a work in progress, the current functionality is:
- track location with a blue cursor. This cursor can move with the left and right arrow keys. 
- type new characters at any space in the editor before the cursor.
- backspace to delete charaters at any space in the editor before the cursor.

Planned improvements:
- add ability to shift for uppercase and special symbols.
- add ability to enter the go down a line.
- add other classes of text, such as a header or subtext.

This program can be run in an IDE with the provided code.
